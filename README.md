# Forest-fire-detection

This Jupyter Notebook presents a deep learning-based solution for forest fire detection using image classification techniques. It utilizes a wildfire dataset sourced via KaggleHub, and implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.

Key Features:

🔗 Integration with KaggleHub for dataset download.

🖼️ Image preprocessing and augmentation using ImageDataGenerator.

🧠 Custom CNN model built with layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout.

⚙️ GPU configuration for faster training.

📊 Visualization of data distribution and training metrics.

This notebook is suitable for anyone exploring the use of CNNs in environmental monitoring applications, especially for detecting wildfires from aerial or satellite images.
